[{"content":"During conversations with my co-founders, whenever I hear something that I disagree with, I convey it to them. I make an effort to be polite when expressing my disagreement.\nBut what if I don’t convey it and act as if there is no disagreement? It\u0026rsquo;s a lie, or the truth hidden.\nIf you never express your disagreement and instead decide to reach a compromise where your opinions are suppressed, from then on, you are lying, and you lose significance.\nExample: suppose you and I are discussing something, and I propose an opinion that benefits me. You don’t agree with me but choose to suppress your opinion and follow my lead. Now, I start to believe that we are on the same page when, in reality, we are not. If this pattern continues, with you always agreeing with me despite your disagreement, eventually, you become irrelevant because you never assert yourself. Here, I am the only relevant person.\n!https://img.freepik.com/premium-vector/two-people-who-have-different-professions-have-same-vision-achieve-good-goal-simple-line-join-line_638785-724.jpg?w=2000\nA conversation gains meaning when all participants contribute. When you express your disagreement, it clarifies your thoughts and helps others understand your perspective.\nI see unexpressed disagreement as small lies. If this behaviour persists, it becomes a significant lie that you must believe every day.\nHere are some examples of how we can politely express disagreement:\n“Hmm… I don’t really agree with what you just said; I think _______ would be better.” “I respect your ideas, but I disagree with this part.” “Are you certain about this? I have a different opinion, and I think we should discuss it further.” “I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely convinced about this, but perhaps we could give it a try.” Inspired from the events that occurred in my career and from the healthy arguments and disagreements me and my co-founders had.\nBefore and after any heated conversations, disagreements or arguments, I always convey that we fought for what’s best for the company, we are not arguing for our personal egos.\n","permalink":"/posts/disagree-if-you-disagree/","summary":"During conversations with my co-founders, whenever I hear something that I disagree with, I convey it to them.

While being the CEO of the company, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to untangle the messes; the company was heading down a path which I would never take. I tried to cope with the mess and acted like there was nothing to untangle, but sooner or later, I realized that by not acting, I was only making it more difficult to clear with each passing day. I decided to resign, informed my co-founders, and tackled the biggest mess I had.\nDo you have waste piled up in a corner, waiting to be dumped outside? And are you still thinking that you can clear it tomorrow? Those are also messes.\nSpot a mess? That’s ‘immediate attention required’ kind of stuff—clear it. Procrastination makes it grow, cluttering your space and mind.\nMess often stems from delays, unclear communication, or lack of clarity. Once you discover a mess, stumble upon it, and clean it up.\nRecently, a customer conflict arose due to a lack of clarity in communication. Once I identified it, I decided to sit down with the customer and untangled the miscommunication. The result? Clarity and resolution. Now, we are on the same page.\nLife can often bring messes. Jump on them immediately.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the first thing you do when you wake up? Making your bed or scrolling social media?—clearing messes or making them bigger? The choice is yours.\nInspired by: Do it today by Sarius Foroux\n","permalink":"/posts/clear-your-mess-right-now/","summary":"I resigned from my previous company, and I was clearing up my mess.
