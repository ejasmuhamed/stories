Now, I read and write to fill my pot.\nWriting these short posts with relevant reading brings clarity.\nReading a book from an author who researched a decade (to write it) gives me instant accessibility to a decade long research.\nI read to write!\nAre you a reader too?\nRecently (as of Jan 2024) I started to read more relevant stuff and started to articulate my thoughts. These actions helped me in gaining more clarity. Thoughts are not just thoughts anymore; I am writing and defining them.\nThanks to Fathima Nasreen, my wife, companion and my best friend for mentioning that I was clueless because my pot was empty. She keeps reminding me about the Qur’an and how it can define us as a person.\nThanks to Faris Mohamed, my akhi (once a college junior, became a friend, then a co-founder to a brother) for sharing relevant stuff to read.\nبارك الله فيكم\n","permalink":"/posts/read-to-write/","summary":"I write because I read—it gives definition and clarity to my thoughts, influencing my actions.\nArticulating my ideas through writing solidifies my understanding.

A leap from building websites to heading a company\u0026rsquo;s tech team; impossible, but that happened.\nI made a significant error in not starting slow, opting rapid climb up the leadership ladder. The C-suite title tempted me more than the Junior Software Engineer role. Ever since that, I have never worked below a C-suite role, or rather I was not able to.\nI faced the dual reality of being unprepared for the position and the pressure to quickly acquire the necessary skills. In the middle of chaos, I somehow fulfilled the responsibilities.\nFast forwarding to today, I see young talents choosing the C-suite in their own one week old company; the only advice echoes ‘start slow’.\nTitles will be tempting, but think long term, think stable, think realistic, think without bluffing to yourself, don’t try to bypass milestones. The process you hate is the process you need!\nThese are not regrets but learnings from the mistakes that I have done whilst building my career. I lead a team of engineers now. I was created from the learnings, advices from wise people and moreover a lot of trials and errors. I wish people to discover the slow but fast alternate journey.\nThanks to Faris Mohamed for unintentionally giving me the title to this story.
