Often I picture myself as an astronaut who **explores the outer space**, returning with **exciting cosmic stones**.

In this cosmic journey, the treasures are the help, opportunities, kindness and shared experiences that **I bring to my world—my family, team, and friends**.

When I built **[Bytsolv](https://byt.so)** with my team, I ensured its design theme mirrored outer-space; **my playground**. Together, my team and I explore the cosmic stones!

This analogy resonates with me.

_Do you have such an analogy?_
